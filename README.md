# ES Binding Pane

It can be tricky to establish a Javascript file's contents, and even more difficult to track down which parts of other modules it depends on. *ES Binding Pane* is an [Atom](atom.io) plugin that aims to provide this contextual information as a simple pane on top of the workspace.

Currently this project is in an alpha stage, and not considered usable.
