# ES Binding Pane

It can be tricky to establish a Javascript file's contents, and even more difficult to track down which parts of other modules it depends on. The aim of this Atom plugin is to provide this contextual information as a simple pane on the right of the workspace.

Currently this project is in an alpha stage, and not considered usable.
